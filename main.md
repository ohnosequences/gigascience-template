### Abstract

The Abstract of the manuscript should not exceed 250 words and must be structured into three separate sections:

#### Background

the context and purpose of the study

#### Results

the context and purpose of the study

#### Conclusions

the context and purpose of the study

##### Keywords

Three to ten keywords representing the main content of the article.

### Background

The background section should be written in a way that is accessible to researchers without specialist knowledge in that area and must clearly state - and, if helpful, illustrate - the background to the research and its aims. The section should end with a brief statement of what is being reported in the article.

### Data Description

A statement providing background and purpose for collection of these data should be presented for readers without specialist knowledge in that area. A brief description of the protocol for data collection, data curation and quality control, as well as potential uses should be included, as well as outlining how the data can be accessed if it is not deposited in our repository.

### Analyses

This section should provide details of all of the experiments and analyses that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. The authors should make clear the goal of each analysis and state the basic findings.

### Potential implications (optional)

This is an optional section of no more than 250 words, where authors can provide some additional comments about potential, more broad-ranging implications of their work that are not directly related to the current focus of their manuscript. This section is meant to promote discussion on possible ways the findings or data presented might be used in or have a relationship with other areas of research that may not be directly apparent in the work. Explicit personal opinions by the authors are permitted, however, references or related information to support the propositions should be included.

### Methods

The methods section should include the design of the study, the type of materials involved, a clear description of all comparisons, and the type of analysis used, to enable replication of the work. Ease of reproducibility is one of the key criteria on which reviewers will by asked to comment, so we strongly advocate the use of the reporting checklists recommended by the [BioSharing network](http://www.biosharing.org/) and workflow management systems such as [Galaxy](http://galaxy.psu.edu/). All test datasets and other relevant material used for assessing their data and analyses need to be made available through the journal database, supplementary information, or an equally accessible site, as appropriate.

### Availability of supporting data

 GigaScience requires authors to deposit the data set(s) supporting the results reported in submitted manuscripts in a publicly-accessible data repository. This section should only be included when supporting data are available and must include the name of the repository and the permanent identifier or accession number and persistent hyperlink(s) for the data set(s). The following format is required:

> "The data set(s) supporting the results of this article is(are) available in the [repository name] repository, [unique persistent identifier and hyperlink to dataset(s) in http:// format]."

We also recommend that the data set(s) be cited, where appropriate in the manuscript, and included in the reference list.

A list of available scientific research data repositories can be found [here](http://www.datacite.org/repolist). A list of all BioMed Central journals that require or encourage this section to be included in research articles can be found [here](http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/supportingdata).

### List of abbreviations (optional)

If abbreviations are used in the text they should be defined in the text at first use, and a list of abbreviations can be provided, which should precede the competing interests and authors' contributions.

### Competing interests

A competing interest exists when your interpretation of data or presentation of information may be influenced by your personal or financial relationship with other people or organizations. Authors must disclose any financial competing interests; they should also reveal any non-financial competing interests that may cause them embarrassment were they to become public after the publication of the manuscript.

Authors are required to complete a declaration of competing interests. All competing interests that are declared will be listed at the end of published articles. Where an author gives no competing interests, the listing will read 'The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests'.

When completing your declaration, please consider the following questions:

_Financial competing interests_

- In the past five years have you received reimbursements, fees, funding, or salary from an organization that may in any way gain or lose financially from the publication of this manuscript, either now or in the future? Is such an organization financing this manuscript (including the article-processing charge)? If so, please specify.
- Do you hold any stocks or shares in an organization that may in any way gain or lose financially from the publication of this manuscript, either now or in the future? If so, please specify.
- Do you hold or are you currently applying for any patents relating to the content of the manuscript? Have you received reimbursements, fees, funding, or salary from an organization that holds or has applied for patents relating to the content of the manuscript? If so, please specify.
- Do you have any other financial competing interests? If so, please specify.

_Non-financial competing interests_

Are there any non-financial competing interests (political, personal, religious, ideological, academic, intellectual, commercial or any other) to declare in relation to this manuscript? If so, please specify.

If you are unsure as to whether you, or one your co-authors, has a competing interest please discuss it with the editorial office.

### Authors' contributions

In order to give appropriate credit to each author of a paper, the individual contributions of authors to the manuscript should be specified in this section.

An 'author' is generally considered to be someone who has made substantive intellectual contributions to a published study. To qualify as an author one should 1) have made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) have given final approval of the version to be published. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.

We suggest the following kind of format (please use initials to refer to each author's contribution): AB carried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript. JY carried out the immunoassays. MT participated in the sequence alignment. ES participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis. FG conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed in an acknowledgements section. Examples of those who might be acknowledged include a person who provided purely technical help, writing assistance, or a department chair who provided only general support.

### Authors' information (optional)

You may choose to use this section to include any relevant information about the author(s) that may aid the reader's interpretation of the article, and understand the standpoint of the author(s). This may include details about the authors' qualifications, current positions they hold at institutions or societies, or any other relevant background information. Please refer to authors using their initials. Note this section should not be used to describe any competing interests.

### Acknowledgements

Please acknowledge anyone who contributed towards the article by making substantial contributions to conception, design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, or who was involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content, but who does not meet the criteria for authorship. Please also include the source(s) of funding for each author, and for the manuscript preparation. Authors must describe the role of the funding body, if any, in design, in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; and in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Please also acknowledge anyone who contributed materials essential for the study. If a language editor has made significant revision of the manuscript, we recommend that you acknowledge the editor by name, where possible.
